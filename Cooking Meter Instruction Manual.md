## FAQ

### __1. I don't see three different colored bars on the meter?__

This usually means one of the following :

* The first two ingredients add up to 100%, thus there is no third ingredient to display 
* One or more of the bars are set to the same color
* You may be colorblind and see two colors as the same

The first bulletin point is intended behavior. For the second and third, please visit the __Adjusting Settings__ section to change the color scheme to your needs

### __2. My meter is teared, not displaying properly__

If the meter looks something like this : 

Then this is a side effect of adjusting the pixel length of the meter while the Cooking Meter is still running. Click the __Adjust__ button once to fix the display.

If this problem occurs regularly without adjusting the pixel length of the meter,  please post an issue with a bug tag and reproduction steps as to when the bug occurs.
