## FAQ

### __1. I don't see three different colored bars on the meter?__

This usually means one of the following :

* The first two ingredients add up to 100%, thus there is no third ingredient to display 
* One or more of the bars are set to the same color
* You may be colorblind and see two colors as the same

The first bulletin point is intended behavior. For the second and third, please visit the __Adjusting Settings__ section to change the color scheme to your needs. If after checking and this is not one of the issues, please post an issue with the bug tag (preferably with a screenshot of the meter) and I will look into the issue.

### 2. The meter does not fit the progress bar on the Cooking Interface properly

Please visit the __Adjusting Settings__ section to see how to change the pixel measurements of the cooking interface. If the current options for adjusting the pixel measurements are not enough, please post an issue with a screenshot of your cooking interface so that I may look into adding/changing the settings as necessary.

### __3. My meter is teared, not displaying properly__

If the meter looks something like this : 

Then this is a side effect of adjusting the pixel length of the meter while the Cooking Meter is still running. Click the __Adjust__ button once to fix the display.

If this problem occurs regularly without adjusting the pixel length of the meter,  please post an issue with a bug tag and reproduction steps as to when the bug occurs.
